I am an Electrical Engineering student with a passion for the dynamic interplay of technology and innovation. I'm currently completing my degree in Electrical Engineering with an emphasis on Control and Automation, constantly seeking to expand my knowledged base and skills in this field.

Over the course of the past years, I have immersed myself in the Robotics research, with a particular emphasis on the development of intelligent hardware solutions for smart factory environments. Within the eRobotica laboratory, my academic jorney have been throught a comprehensive range of robotics fields, including path planning, mapping, computer vision, and the development of digital twins. This hands-on experience has afforded me the opportunity to acquire a profound understanding of the practical application of mobile robot creation and simulation, as well as the strategic implementation of computer vision concepts for the advancement of motion capture systems.

In addition to my academic curriculum, I have been an active volunteer with the IEEE RAS UFCG Student Chapter since 2021. My involvement in this prestigious organization has provided me with a collaborative platform with fellow students and professionals, all dedicated to the shared goal of promoting the knowledge and the execution of projects within the robotics and automation landscape.

My areas of specialization include electronics, computer vision, mobile robotics, and artificial intelligence. I have experience in a variety of programming language and frameworks, including Python, C++, MATLAB, ROS, Git and Github, as well as Embedded Linux.

I am seeking for new challenges and opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in a manner that contributes to the advancement of technology and the betterment of society. I am a dedicated professional, equipped with robust problem-solving abilities, a collaborative spirit and a effective communication.
