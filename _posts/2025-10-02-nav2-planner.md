Ever wonder how a mobile robot intelligently navigates from its charging dock to the kitchen without bumping into walls or falling down the stairs? The magic behind this is a process called path planning. Think of it as your robot's personal GPS, but instead of navigating roads, it's charting a course through a much more complex and dynamic environment like a warehouse floor or your living room.

The primary objective of a path planning algorithm is straightforward: **to find the safest and most efficient route from a starting point (Point A) to a destination (Point B)**. It takes a map of the environment, often represented as a costmap where different values indicate obstacles or difficult terrain, and computes a collision-free series of waypoints for the robot to follow. This calculated route is known as the global path.

## What is `nav2_planner_server`?

Navigation2 stack (Nav2) handles all aspects of autonomous navigation, and the component responsible for generating this global path is the `nav2_planner_server`. Its job is to:

1. Receive a navigation goal.
2. Load the current map of the environment.
3. Use a specific algorithm to compute the optimal path.
4. Publish this path for other Nav2 components, like the controller, to execute.

The `nav2_planner_server` operates using a plugin-based architecture, which means you can easily swap between different path planning algorithms to best suit your robot and its environment. For this, you need to configure the planner serve configuration file, that is usually a YAML file. Here, you define a list of `planner_plugins` that you want to be available. Each plugin is given a unique name and is then mapped to a specific planner implementation.

```yml
planner_server:
  ros__parameters:
    planner_plugins: ['GridBased']
    GridBased:
      plugin: 'nav2_navfn_planner::NavfnPlanner' # In Iron and older versions, "/" was used instead of "::"
      use_astar: True
      allow_unknown: True
      tolerance: 1.0
```

### Using `NavfnPlanner`

The Navfn Planner plugin is the default path planning plugin that is used by the `planner_server`. It's implements a wavefront Dijkstra or A* expanded holonomic planner. Your use its recommend for simple, grid-based navigation where speed is a priority and the robot can be approximated as a circle. It's a great starting point for many applications. Keep in mind that the paths generated can sometimes be jagged or not perfectly smooth, which might not be ideal for all robot controllers. Your parameters are: 

- tolerance: Tolerance in meters between requested goal pose and end of path. The default value is 0.5.
- use_astar: Whether to use A*. If false, uses Dijkstraâ€™s expansion. The default value is False. 
- allow_unknown: Whether to allow planning in unknown space. The default value is True.
- use_final_approach_orientation: If true, the last pose of the path generated by the planner will have its orientation set to the approach orientation, i.e. the orientation of the vector connecting the last two points of the path. The default value is False.
- allow_parameter_qos_overrides: Whether to allow QoS profiles to be overwritten with parameterized values. The default value is True.
